However, the students have old laptops with no battery backup and their work ishindered by frequent power cuts. A power cut occurs once every 1-2 hours and lasts for 10-15 minutesat a time. Whenever a power cut occurs, all students stop their work and wait patiently for the power tocome back up.  After waiting for 5 minutes, a student may simply get bored and drift-off to sleep(with probability 0.4) or manage to stay awake and wait as long as it takes for the power to comeback up (with probability 0.6).   As soon as the power comes back up,  the students that have notyet gone to sleep resume their work from the point where they left off.  The students who slept offunfortunately wake up after 8am, when the submission deadline is already past.Questions1.[Submit code]Model this scenario using SimPy. Each simulation should cover the time frommidnight until 7am.  Run the simulation once to show a detailed activity log showing all in-stances when power went/came back, what each student was doing and how much work wasremaining. At the end of every simulation run, a summary should be printed showing the totalnumber of students that finished the assignment on time, the total number of power outages,the average time it took for a student to finish the work (across only the students that finishedthe work on time) etc
